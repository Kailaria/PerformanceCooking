Includes one singular Unlock Card by the same name as the project:
* Massive patience penalty to the Service & Waiting For Food phases
* Partially negating that penalty by turning the penalty from Hobs being close to tables into a bonus
* Slowing down patience loss when customers can see players
* *Further* slowing down patience loss *significantly* when appliances near tables are processing *while* they see players.
