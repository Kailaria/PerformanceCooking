# PerformanceCooking
A PlateUp! mod to encourage cooking and prepping next to tables as though players were running a hibachi-/teppanyaki-style restaurant.

Includes one singular Unlock Card that accomplishes this by:
* Massive patience penalty to the Service & Waiting For Food phases
* Partially negating that penalty by turning the penalty from Hobs being close to tables into a bonus
* Slowing down patience loss when customers can see players
* *Further* slowing down patience loss *significantly* when appliances near tables are processing *while* they see players.
